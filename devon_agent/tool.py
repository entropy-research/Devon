# - needs context (env,state)
# - pre and post functions

# tool


"""
Interaction with environment by the agent happens through tools.

A tool will take a context and return a response.

The context is a dict that contains the following keys:
- environment: The environment object that the tool is interacting with.
- session: The session object that the tool is part of.
- state: The state object that the tool is working with.


Sometimes tools form a logical group, such as a file editor or a code search tool. In this case, tool boxes can be used to group tools together.

Often, you want to run operations before and after a tool is called. pre and post functions can be used to achieve this.

Tools are often passed to llms as prompts or function calling. Every tool should supoport generating a prompt in various formats (docstring,markdown,xml,jsonschema,function call, etc.). Util functions will be provided to help with this.
